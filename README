This project creates and producer and consumer threads to show the producer-consumer problem. The table
holds two items. The producer produces items if the table is not full. The consumer then consums these items.
It will not try to consume items if the table is empty.

To compile/run:
gcc -pthread ProCon.c -o ProCon.out
./ProCon.out
